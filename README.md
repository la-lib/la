LA (Lightweight Abstractions) is a lightweight, freestanding C++ framework
designed to create cross-platform graphical applications with minimal dependencies. 

Similar to Flutter, LA provides a unified API for building 
interfaces on Android, Windows, Linux, WebAssembly, iOS, and others, 
using platform-specific wrappers only when necessary (e.g. Java/NDK, Swift, ObjC).

At least, this is the goal.
